        Based in Stockholm. All prices agreed upon individually based on your
        preferred total package. My main focus as a photographer is to reflect
        the right feeling and atmosphere from your event, may it be a banquet, a
        couples portrait at home. an event at the racetrack or simply a
        carshoot.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work a lot with angles, colors and the natural lighting to reflect
        that special feeling combined with using foreground and background to
        provide a sense of depth to the picture I always provide edited high
        resolution photos per default, but I can also provide original unedited
        versions if preferred. I can also provide physically framed photos set
        done and ready to hang up on your living room wall. Standard formats are
        50*70 cm or 60*80 cm. But can also offer custom measurements and custom
        frames.

        This is a slightly more premium service and thus slightly higher priced.
        But something I highly recommend in order to give that personal touch to
        your home whilst at the same time preserving a special memory to show
        for your friends and family. Don't hesitate to contact me for further
        dialogue.
